<h2>How many Pokemon are there?</h2>
<p><pre><center>
All of the licensed Pokémon properties overseen by The Pokémon Company are
 divided roughly by generation. These generations are roughly chronological 
 divisions by release; when an official sequel in the main role-playing game
 series is released that features new Pokémon, characters, and possibly new 
 gameplay concepts, that sequel is considered the start of a new generation 
 of the franchise. The main games and their spin-offs, the anime, manga and 
 trading card game are all updated with the new Pokémon properties each time 
 a new generation begins. The franchise began its seventh and current generation
 with Pokémon Sun and Moon, which were released worldwide on November 18, 2016.

<center><h2>Eighth Generation</h2>
<p><pre>
During E3 2017, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company announced
 that Game Freak was developing a new core Pokémon role-playing
 game set to release for the Nintendo Switch[34] in "2018 or later.
 "[35][36] The game will be the eighth generation of Pokémon.[37]

Along with the announcement of Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and 
Pokémon: Let's Go, Eevee! it was confirmed that another core Pokémon
 role-playing game will be released in late 2019. It was clarified 
 that the 2019 game was the one mentioned during E3 2017, not the Let's
 Go games. Game director Junichi Masuda stated that it will also "follow
 in the tradition of Pokémon X and Y and Pokémon Sun and Moon".[38][39] 
 The CEO of The Pokémon Company, Tsunekazu Ishihara, also confirmed that
 the upcoming core title will not have influences from Pokémon Go like 
 Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee! had.[40][41]

On February 27, 2019, on the 23rd anniversary of the franchise, Pokémon
 Sword and Shield were confirmed for Nintendo Switch, which will be released
 worldwide on November 15,

<h2>Who is Pickachu</h2>
<p><pre><center>
Pikachu is Ash's "Starter" Pokémon. A Starter Pokémon is the 
Pokémon you receive at the beginning of your journey into the
 Pokémon world. You receive it from a Pokémon Professor, like 
 Professor Oak who gave Pikachu to Ash. Pikachu isn't normally
 given to new "Pokémon Trainers" like Ash. In this season of the
 anime, Ash would have chosen either the Grass-type Pokémon 
 Bulbasaur, the Fire-type Charmander or the Water-type Squirtle—
 but only if he had woken up on time! All of these Pokémon were 
 taken by the Trainers who visited Oak before him.
